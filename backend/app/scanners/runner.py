    The destination is keyed by repo name AND a unique suffix (the caller's
    scan_id when available, otherwise a fresh UUID) so that two concurrent
    scans of the same target -- or of different targets that happen to
    share a repo name -- never resolve to the same directory. Previously
    the dir was keyed by repo name alone and unconditionally rmtree'd +
    recloned on every call, which let one scan's rmtree delete files while
    another scan's clone/tool run was still reading them (a race that could
    corrupt or blow up a concurrent scan). Cleaning up old scan workdirs is
    a separate ops concern, intentionally out of scope here.

    Security notes (see also _validate_repo_url/_validate_branch above):
    - repo_url/branch are validated *before* anything else runs, so a
      malicious Target.repo_url (any authenticated user who can create a
      target controls this) is rejected outright instead of reaching git.
    - The clone argv also puts "--" before the positional repo_url, so even
      a validated-but-unusual URL can never be misparsed as a flag.
    - github_token is never embedded in the URL and never appears anywhere
      in the subprocess argv. It's injected as an `http.extraHeader` via
      GIT_CONFIG_* environment variables (git >= 2.31), which git reads out
      of the environment rather than the command line. That matters because
      subprocess.CalledProcessError's str()/repr() includes the full argv
      verbatim -- if the token were on the command line (e.g. via `git -c
      http.extraHeader=...` as an argv entry), it would leak into any log
      line or API response that ever surfaces str(exc) for a failed clone.
